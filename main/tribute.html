    <p class="paragraph">Denmark cut its food waste by 25%. A russian woman, that knew the value of food, started this movement in 2008 with 
    Facebook page called "Stop Spild Af Mad" which means, Stop wasting food.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Some of her brilliant ideas include:</p>
    <li class="list">
        <ul>Instead of a doggy bag to take home unwanted food from restaurants, she rebranded them as “goody bags”
        , and distributed 80,000 across the country. A Danish food blogger summed this up succinctly: 
        “(it’s) food you’ve already paid for – like your groceries – so why wouldn’t you bring them home?”  </ul>
        <ul>Rema 1000, Denmark’s biggest budget supermarket franchise, replaced all high-quantity discounts 
        with single item discounts after a conversation with her. 
        The result? Previously, a single retailer might waste nearly 100 bananas a day.
        Now, one grocer said that the policy change reduced banana waste by 90%,
        after they put up this sign which translates as “take me I’m single.” </ul>
